Hello! I'm Ana Paola Garcia Alonzo, and I am from Mexico.

I am currently pursuing my PhD in Biomedical Engineering at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, MD. I obtained my Bachelors degree from Tecnologico de Monterrey, Guadalajara Campus in Biomedical Engineering (2020-2024). 

As second year PhD student I am approaching the deadline for presenting my DBO (doctoral board oral exam) this summer. With this upcoming deadline I will try to update because I believe in trying to make my own research accessible to the rest of the community (both in English and Spanish).  

I will try to update this site as muchs as I can. 

<!--Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.-->
